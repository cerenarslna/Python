Python Learning Journey 🐍

Welcome to my Python Learning Repository!
I recently started learning Python as part of my professional development, and this repository documents my progress. Here, you’ll find practice exercises, small projects, and notes I’ve created during my learning process.

Goals 🎯

	•	Build a strong foundation in Python (syntax, data structures, functions, OOP).
	•	Work on small projects to apply what I learn.
	•	Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
	•	Be ready to use Python effectively in real-world projects within 3–4 weeks.

Contents 📂

	•	Basics/ → Fundamental Python concepts (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
	•	Exercises/ → Problem-solving and coding challenges.
	•	Projects/ → Small hands-on projects for practice.

Timeline ⏳

	•	Week 1 → Python basics and exercises.


Why this repo? 🤔



I believe in learning by doing. This repository is both a study log for myself and a way to share my progress openly.
